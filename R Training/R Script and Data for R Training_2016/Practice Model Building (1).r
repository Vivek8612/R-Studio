# Practice Model Building

# Step 1: Create a binned variable from NOP with cuts at 2,4,6,8,10,12 and 20
# Build a model with Binned NOP, Browser, OS and EXTERNAL_SEARCH_FLAG to predict purchase (PURCHASE_FLAG)
# Obtain the ROC curve for the 20% test data
# Use the optimal probability cutoff to classify into 1 and 0
#      [Hint: Use function ifelse and optimal cutoff to classify testPrediction into 1 or 0]
# Get the confusion matrix of actual vs predicted [Hint:Use crosstabs]
